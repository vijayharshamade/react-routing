      404 - This is custome Not Found Page for Layout child route ðŸ˜¢ <br />âœ…
      Best Practice: Use top-level wildcard (path: "*"), not one in each nested
      route ðŸ’¡ Why? Keeps your route config clean and DRY (Don't Repeat
      Yourself) React Router will fall through to the top-level * if no match is
      found at any level You don't need to repeat path: "*" inside every child
      route group, unless you want custom 404s per section
    </div>
